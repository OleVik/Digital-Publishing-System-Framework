# Contributing

Pull Requests and Issues are very welcome on this repository, but please review this document first.

## Feature requests

Feature requests are welcome, and submitted to [issues](https://github.com/OleVik/digital-publishing-system-framework/issues). But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to _you_ to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and not contain unrelated commits. They must also adhere to the current code standards. See [Using Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) and [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) if you are not familiar with Pull Requests.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a Pull Request, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the same license as that used by the project.

## Bugs

A good bug report shouldn't leave out information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report.

**Important**: [include Code Samples in triple backticks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks) so that Github will provide a proper indentation. [Add the language name after the backticks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#syntax-highlighting) to add syntax highlighting to the code snippets.
